Elite Dangerous Assistant:

This is my first attempt at a published application, first time using Github and the first time i've asked for any comment on my attempts...

This is a trading assistant for Elite: Dangerous. It utilises OCR of screenshots from the market and manual input of the system/station info.  It then provides (currently) basic access to this for point to point trading and sourcing of specific commodities.  I'm working on expanding this set of features.

While i commend people for their focus on collaboration with other players to create a massive repository of knowledge, my own personal feeling is that this application is no more than a vastly improved notepad for budding traders.  It wouldn't take someone very long to modify it to share results i'm sure and i'm perfectly happy for someone to do so.  Everyone should feel free to steal whatever they deem worthy from this project.  Just give me a nod of recognition and i'll be happy :)

With that sentiment I must give thanks to seeebek from whom I pilfered the trained data file for my OCR.  I tried to train it myself but i sucked at it. Without him this entire project would be worthless


My coding is my very own style (having noone else to compare it to)
My error handling is admittedly sucky, i prefer not to encounter any...
I have no concept of source control (yet)


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

FOR A NEW INSTALL : 
Download and run the latest version of the msi install file (e.g. EDAv0.4.2.msi)

TO UPDATE AN EXISTING INSTALLATION :
Download the latest version of the EDUpdater (e.g. EDUpdater v0.4.2.exe)
Place in the installation directory for Elite Dangerous Assistant (e.g. c:\Program Files (x86)\Shady Enterprises Ltd\EliteDangerousAssistant)
Run the EDUpdater application (Administrator priveleges used to access and alter the Database structure)


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Elite must be run in windowed mode (seamless)
Take market screenshots using F10 (not ALT+F10)
When taking screenshots please make sure the exit button is highlighted (highlighting an item in the market makes the OCR almost useless)
The options are there to be played with - the defaults are what I found to be most useful
